Welcome to my inn! What brings you here?

::sidequest_intro
Aye, maybe I do. Been waiting on a delivery of ale since yesterday, but my cask’s still not here. The man bringing it should’ve come down the road from the woods by now.
* [I'll see what I can do. You think something happened?] { actions: startQuest findLostBarrel } -> sidequest_start
* [I'm not interested] -> start

::sidequest_start
Wouldn’t surprise me. The woods by the old cemetery’ve been giving folks the chills of late. Strange lights at night, whispers in the fog… bah, nonsense, I hope. Still, if you’re headed that way, keep your eyes open. See if you can find my barrel and the poor fool driving the cart. Bring me word, and I’ll make it worth your while.
* [Sure] -> start

::sidequest_complete_1
Skeletons? Don’t jest with me, traveler. You’ve had too much of that rotgut, haven’t you? Dead men don’t walk—least not around here
* [I know what I saw. The man’s blood’s still wet on the ground.] -> sidequest_complete_2

::sidequest_complete_2
(takes a deep breath, uneasy) Gods help us… Maybe there’s truth in the old tales after all. Here, take this. My sword’s seen better days, but it’s sharper than your tongue, I reckon. If you’re bound to wander near cursed ground, you’ll need it more than I do.
* [Thanks, it will come in handy] -> start

::gossip
Ha! You must be lost. There’s naught here but miners, mud, and my ale. The forest keeps the city folk away — wolves, bandits, spirits, who knows. We send ore down the road, and once a month the merchants brave the wilds to fetch it. Till then, it’s just us and the wind howlin’ through the trees.
* [next] -> start

::main_quest_update_1
(laughs) Lost, eh? You’re not the first, and won’t be the last. City’s west of here, but the road’s half-swallowed by the woods these days. Folk say the forest’s got a mind of its own — shifts the paths when it feels like it.
* [So… which way do I go, then?] -> main_quest_update_2

::main_quest_update_2
See that old oak behind the stable? A path starts just there. Follow it through the edge of the forest — don’t wander deep, mind you — and keep west till the trees thin and you hit open fields. From there, you’ll see the hills, and beyond ’em, the city smoke. If you reach the swamp, you’ve gone too far… or you’ve angered something best left alone.
* [Sounds… reassuring.] -> main_quest_update_3

::main_quest_update_3
(laughs again) Bah! You’ll be fine. Worst you’ll meet’s a hungry fox or a drunk miner. Probably.
* [Thanks, I’ll manage] -> start

::end
See you soon, my friend!
* [end] { actions: end }
